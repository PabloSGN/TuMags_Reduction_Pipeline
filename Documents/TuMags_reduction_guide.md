# TuMag's reduction step by step guide. 


## Reduction levels

Fits files at different stages of the reduction process will be provided, identified with the **reduction level**. Additionally, data will be provided with and without wavefront reconstruction. The details of each level and the steps that have been applied to the data are summarized in this table: 

| Reduction Level | Flats + Darks | Wavefront reconstruction | Alignment and filtering | Stokes Parameters |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **0.5** | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :x: |
| **0.6** | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |
