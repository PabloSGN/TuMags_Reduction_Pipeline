# Correcting observations

The standard procedure of dtaa correction is the following:
1. Compute the **dark current** (DC).
2. Compute the **flat-fields** (FFs).
3. Compute the field-stop from the FFs and align the two cameras. 
4. Process the observation mode and align the cameras.
5. Correct the FFs. 
6. Demodulate. 
7. Correct X-talk. 

Let's go over these steps...
