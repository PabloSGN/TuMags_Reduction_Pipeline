- config.py : Config fie with headers info, observation modes info, etc
- demodulation.py : Module to compute demodulation. 
- field_stop_finder.py : Module to find field stop and align images. 
- fringes.py : Module to clean images from fringes. 
- image_handler.py : Module to read .img files, process observation modes, flat-field modes.
- master_dark.py : Module to compute dark current. 
- master_flat_field : Module to compute master flat-fields- 
- organizer.py : Python script to generate the IDs for the images.   
- requirements.txt : Dependencies to run the pipeline.

## Overview of TuMag's observations

### Timelines

TuMag observations were stuctured through  **timelines**, a list of pre-configured commands where calibration and scientific observations were already programmed. 

A summary of the observations and the corresponding timelines can be foound in [Observation summary](Documents/Sunrise_summary_observations.pdf). 

For a guide describing TuMag's commands for each timeline see [Juli√°n's webpage](https://www.uv.es/jublanro/TuMag_timeline_reference.html). 

<ins>Important:</ins> When working with the data have in mind that the timelines were paused and stopped, some commands were run manually, others aborted, etc ... The webpage should be used as a reference. 

All observations (scientific and calibrations) are recorded and grouped in their corresponding Timeline in the [Tumag's Logbook](Documents/TuMagCompass.csv). 

Tumag observations are operated through pre-configured **observation modes**.
