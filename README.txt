## Installation of required libraries. 

### IAA's server guide

Install the required libraries through a virtual enviroment:

- Anywhere on your directories -> run the command: "python3 -m venv $myenv$", substituting $myenv$ for whatever name you want to give it. 
- Activate the enviroment: run the command: "source $myenv$/bin/activate.csh", again substitute the name. 
- Install dependencies:  "pip install -r requirements.txt"

You should be able to run any script after the installation finishes with the enviroment activated.
