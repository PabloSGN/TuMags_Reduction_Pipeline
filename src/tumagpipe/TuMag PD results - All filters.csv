Note,,9 iterations for one subpatch. Large dispersion on Zernikes.,Some subpatches converge at 8 and two of them at 11 and 12 iterations,9 iteration for one subpatch,,"5-7 iterations, except four a couple subpatches with 10 and 12 iterations",We sum the whole realigned series to improve convergence.,,Sunspot. Same flat and dark than for the 07:16 dataset.,,,Sunspot,8 iterations for one subpatch,The restoration looks very good,One subpatch took 9 iterations to convege,The telescope is moving along the PD series. Use the PD at 13:07 (timelime CALL_1),,Very low WFE rms,10 and 18 iterations for two subpatches,
